# The Lesson

All goals are related to [Week 1 - Learning Objectives](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/syllabus/blob/master/html-css/week-1/learning-objectives.md)

## What will I learn about today?

Main format will be Demos and Lectures

- **HTML Syntax Basics** - HTML tags and attributes

- **CSS Syntax Basics** - box model, pseudo classes and advanced selectors

- **Software Engineering Principle** - Separation of concern

## Why is learning this important?

- Help you understand how to build Basic UI (User Interfaces) - these technologies help humans interact with machines

## What can we use these skills for?

- Learn to create a basic UI
- Understand how to structure and organise basic software - static webpage
- Understanding HTML and CSS is needed to learn "React", a future module
